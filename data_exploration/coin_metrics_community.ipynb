      "SplyMiner1HopAllNtv - The sum of the balances of all addresses within one hop of a mining entity. An address within one hop of a mining entity is defined as an address that has been credited from a transaction debiting the 'FEES' or 'ISSUANCE' accounts, or any address that has been credited in a transaction sent by such an address.\n",
      "SplyMiner1HopAllUSD - The sum of the balances of all addresses within one hop of a mining entity in USD. An address within one hop of a mining entity is defined as an address that has been credited from a transaction debiting the 'FEES' or 'ISSUANCE' accounts, or any address that has been credited in a transaction sent by such an address.\n",
      "TxCnt - The sum count of transactions that interval. Transactions represent a bundle of intended actions to alter the ledger initiated by a user (human or machine). Transactions are counted whether they execute or not and whether they result in the transfer of native units or not (a transaction can result in no, one, or many transfers). Changes to the ledger mandated by the protocol (and not by a user) or post-launch new issuance issued by a founder or controlling entity are not included here.\n",
      "TxCntSec - The sum count of transactions divided by the number of seconds that interval.\n",
      "TxTfrCnt - The sum count of transfers that interval. Transfers represent movements of native units from one ledger entity to another distinct ledger entity. Only transfers that are the result of a transaction and that have a positive (non-zero) value are counted.\n",
      "TxTfrValAdjNtv - The sum of native units transferred between distinct addresses that interval removing noise and certain artifacts.\n",
      "TxTfrValAdjUSD - The USD value of the sum of native units transferred between distinct addresses that interval removing noise and certain artifacts.\n",
      "TxTfrValMeanNtv - The sum value of native units transferred divided by the count of transfers (i.e., the mean size of a transfer) between distinct addresses that interval.\n",
      "TxTfrValMeanUSD - The sum USD value of native units transferred divided by the count of transfers (i.e., the mean size in USD of a transfer) between distinct addresses that interval.\n",
      "TxTfrValMedNtv - The median count of native units transferred per transfer (i.e., the median size of a transfer) between distinct addresses that interval.\n",
      "TxTfrValMedUSD - The median USD value transferred per transfer (i.e., the median size in USD of a transfer) between distinct addresses that interval.\n",
      "VelCur1yr - The ratio of the value transferred (i.e., the aggregate size of all transfers) in the trailing 1 year divided by the current supply up to the end of that interval. It can be thought of as a rate of turnover -- the number of times that an average native unit has been transferred in the past 1 year.\n",
      "VtyDayRet180d - The 180D volatility, measured as the standard deviation of the natural log of daily returns over the past 180 days.\n",
      "VtyDayRet30d - The 30D volatility, measured as the standard deviation of the natural log of daily returns over the past 30 days.\n",
      "principal_market_price_usd - The price of an asset quoted in U.S. dollars derived from the asset's principal market, the market with the most trading volume or activity.\n",
      "principal_market_usd - The asset's principal market, the market with the most trading volume or activity.\n"
